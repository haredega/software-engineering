This is a project of a simple accounting system to replace an XLS implementation that I've been using.
Its intent is to develop my coding skills wilst doing something useful and to which I've already choosen to take an effort.

The implementation will be done in HTML, CSS, PHP. As I'm also willing to learn Agile development techniques, I'll implement the whole app by writing my own User Stories.

User Story 1:
- A user logs in and adds a financial movement between two or more accounts. If the account isn't already listed, he may insert it as a new account into the Account table
